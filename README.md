This repository contains practice code in PyTorch for training Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) on handwritten digit datasets, such as MNIST. It includes implementations CNN architecture, data preprocessing technique, training loop, and evaluation metrics. The project serves as a practical guide for understanding and applying CNNs in image classification tasks.
