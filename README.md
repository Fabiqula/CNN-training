This repository contains practice code in PyTorch for training Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) on handwritten digit datasets, such as MNIST. It includes implementations of LSTM CNN architectures, data preprocessing techniques, training loops, and evaluation metrics. The project serves as a practical guide for understanding and applying CNNs in image classification tasks.
